# writing-line-segmentation
Processes images that contain text / writing and groups characters into lines. This is an adapted + extended version of the blocking algorithm presented in Text Binarization in Color Documents by Badekas, Nikolaou, and Papamarkos.

![An example result from running the line segmentation code on test_images/PR8.png.tiff. Note that this
only shows one of the line segments found from PR8](https://github.com/davidxc/writing-line-segmentation/blob/master/line_segment_images/line_segment_example_result_PR8.png)
